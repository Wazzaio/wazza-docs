# Introduction

The Wazza API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you're using API bindings, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).

We have language SDKs in Shell, objective-C and Java. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Registration

Head on to the [register] page to register your account. If you have a promocode, use it and you will get early access.
You will receive an e-mail whenever your account is activated and you may begin to use it as you will.

# Authentication

You authenticate to the Wazza API by providing your secret API key in the request. You can manage your API keys from your account. Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secret!
Authentication to the API occurs via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username. You do not need to provide a password.
All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. You must authenticate for all requests.


> To authorize, use this code:

```smalltalk
[WazzaAnalytics initWithCredentials:@@"Company Name" :@@"App Name" :@@"API token"];
[WazzaAnalytics setDelegate:self];
```

```java
// Keep in mind you will still need to open and close sessions. Further information can be found in SDKs Integration documentation.
Wazza wazza = Wazza.init(this, "API_KEY", "Application Name", "Company Name");
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://www.wazza.io/api/auth/"
  -H "SDK-TOKEN: API_KEY"
```

> Make sure to replace `API_KEY` with your API key.


### HTTP Request

`POST https://www.wazza.io/api/auth/`

The sent header looks like this:
`SDK-TOKEN: API_KEY`

Additionally, an optional header can be sent if the user exists or not. It is up to the sender to store that information, which can be done analysing the result of API call. The goal of this is to reduce the number of database requests for user existence. A boolean result is sent if a mobile user was created or not.

This header looks like this:
`X-UserExists: *optional*`

### Success Response:

* **Code:** 200
* **Content:**
  ```json
    {
      "result": "[boolean]"
    }
  ```

### Error Response:

  * **Code:** 404 NOT FOUND
  * **Content:** `{}`


<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.

# Sessions

## Save session
Saves information regarding one or more sessions.

> To authorize, use this code:

```smalltalk
[WazzaAnalytics initWithCredentials:@@"Company Name" :@@"App Name" :@@"API token"];
[WazzaAnalytics setDelegate:self];
```

```java
// Keep in mind you will still need to open and close sessions. Further information can be found in SDKs Integration documentation.
Wazza wazza = Wazza.init(this, "API_KEY", "Application Name", "Company Name");
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://www.wazza.io/api/auth/"
  -H "SDK-TOKEN: API_KEY"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
    {
      "userId": "[string]",
      "applicationName": "[string]",
      "companyName": "[string]",
      "startTime": "[string]",
      "endTime": "[string]",
      "deviceInfo": {
        "osName": "[string]",
        "osVersion": "[string]",
        "deviceModel": "[string]"
      },
      "location": "#optional"{
        "latitude": "[double]",
        "longitude": "[double]"
      },
      "purchases":[
        {
          "[string]"
        },
        "..."
      ]
    }
```

### HTTP Request

`POST https://www.wazza.io/api/session/new/`

### Success Response:

* **Code:** 200
* **Content:**
  ```json
    {}
  ```

### Error Response:

  * **Code:** 404 NOT FOUND
* **Content:**
  ```json
    {}
  ```

## Payment

## Analytics

The SDKs are designed to feed information into our engine and not to collect it; therefore, any request shall be made using the REST API directly.

# SDKs Integration

The integration process is designed to be as easy as possible with basic setup complete in under 5 minutes.

- Android
    1. Download the Wazza Android SDK.
     The archive should contain these files:
      - Wazza_Android_SDK_x.y.z.jar : The library containing Wazza's analytic collection and reporting code (where x.y.x denotes the latest version of Wazza SDK).
      - ProjectApiKey.txt : This file contains the name of your project and your project's API key. Alternatively, you can also get the key in the Dashboard.
      - README.pdf : PDF file containing instructions (This exact same information).

    2. Add the Wazza lib to your project
      - If you're using Eclipse, modify your Java Build Path, and choose Add External JAR.
      - If you're using the SDK tools directly, drop it into your libs folder and the ant task will pick it up.

    3. Configure your AndroidManifest.xml to:
      - Have access to the Internet and allow Wazza SDK to check state of the network connectivity
      - You may specify a versionName attribute in the manifest to have data reported under that version name
      - Declare min version of Android OS the application supports. Please note that Wazza supports Android OS versions 15 and above.

        ```xml
         <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
             package="io.wazza.sample"
             android:versionCode="1"
             android:versionName="1.0" >
         
        <uses-sdk
             android:minSdkVersion="15"
             android:targetSdkVersion="19" />
             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
        </manifest>
        ```

      {{create gist}}

    4. Incorporate the following lines of Wazza code:
      - For each activity of your application, add:<br>
        ```java
          import io.wazza.sdk.android.Wazza;
        ```
        and on onCreate():<br>
        ```java
          Wazza wazza = Wazza.init(this, "API KEY", "Application Name", "Company Name");
          wazza.sessionOpen();
        ```
        and on onStop():<br>
        ```java
          wazza.sessionClose();
        ```
      - Whenever you call the Google In-app Billing service, swap that call with Wazza's one:<br>
        ```java
          wazza.purchase("SKU");
        ```

    That's it. We recommend always calling Wazza from the main (UI) thread. The results are not guaranteed or supported when called from other threads.

- iOS
    1. Download the Wazza iOS SDK
     The archive should contain these files:
      - Wazza code - contains library .a file and folder with headers
      - ProjectApiKey.txt : This file contains the name of your project and your project's API key. Alternatively, you can also get the key in the Dashboard.
      - README.pdf : PDF file containing instructions (This exact same information).

    2. Drag **Wazza** folder to your Xcode project:

      ![Alt Text](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wazza-landing-page/ios+doc+-+2.png "Figure 2 - Draging")

    3. Select **Copy items into destination Group's folder** and choose **Create groups for any added folders**:

      ![Alt Text](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wazza-landing-page/ios+doc+-+3.png "Figure 2 - Draging")

    4. Code setup.

      The first step you need to do is to initialize Wazza's singleton with your API token (you can get it on app setting of Wazza's dashboard).

      ```objective-c
      [WazzaAnalytics initWithCredentials:@@"Company Name" :@@"App Name" :@@"API token"];
      [WazzaAnalytics setDelegate:self];
      ```

      From this moment on, each time you want to use Wazza's singleton, you can use it with:

      ```objective-c
      [WazzaAnalytics sharedInstance];
      ```

      Next, you need to put the following code every time a session is closed.

      ```objective-c
      [[WazzaAnalytics sharedInstance] endSession];
      ```

      On every **in-app purchase action** you will need to add the following code

      ```objective-c
      [[WazzaAnalytics sharedInstance] makePurchase:@@"PRODUCT_ID"];
      ```

    4. Code setup.

    The first step you need to do is to initialize Wazza's singleton with your API token (you can get it on app setting of Wazza's dashboard).

```objective-c
[WazzaAnalytics initWithCredentials:@"Company Name" :@"App Name" :@"API token"];
[WazzaAnalytics setDelegate:self];
```

From this moment on, each time you want to use Wazza's singleton, you can use it with:

```objective-c
[WazzaAnalytics sharedInstance];
```

Next, you need to put the following code every time a session is closed.

```objective-c
[[WazzaAnalytics sharedInstance] endSession];
```

On every **in-app purchase action** you will need to add the following code

```objective-c
[[WazzaAnalytics sharedInstance] makePurchase:@"PRODUCT_ID"];
```
